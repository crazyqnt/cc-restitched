## This is a hastily created port of CC:Restitched to MC 1.18. Use at your own risk.

## Changes in this fork:

- Implemented a redneck replacement for the missing fabric-networking-blockentity API
- Removed dependency on modmenu
- 1.18 adjustments:
  - implemented new tick scheduling
  - changed MatrixStack.Entry method name
  - implemented Mixin to access BlockEntity.writeNBT
  - other small stuff

# CC: R Version VS CC: T Version
CC: R Strives to maintain perfect pairity with CC: T, however in some cases this is not possible, so CC: R might have a "newer" version than what CC: T has, these newer versions will be primarily bugfixes and the like because [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) is "weird" when porting a Forge mod.

## What is CC: Restiched
This is an fork of [Zundrel/cc-tweaked-fabric](https://github.com/Zundrel/cc-tweaked-fabric) who's goal was to port [SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/SquidDev-CC/CC-Tweaked) to the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) modloader. I picked up maintaining the mod because the team working on Zundrel's fork can no longer mantain it so, I picked it up to make it as equal as possible with CC: T.

## Resource Packs
This mod includes textures that are more in-line with the style of Mojang's new texture-artist, Jappa. If you prefer the original textures, enable the "Classic" resource pack.

We also have a second resourcepack made by [3prm3](https://github.com/3prm3), it features a complete overhaul and can be enabled by enabling the `overhaul` resource pack, go check out his resource pack over here!

# Does this work with shaders/[Sodium?](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric)
* [ YES ] Sodium
* [ YES ] Optifine
	* Works with VBO Rendering (automatically set)
	* No issues
* [ EHH ] Iris Shaders
	* "Works" with TBO Rendering (Default)
	* Crashes with VBO Rendering
	* <details>
		<summary>Shaders are broken</summary>

		* Shaders will cause varrying results ranging from monitors being invisible, to straight up crashing.
		* Not using shaders will result in odd Z-Fighting of the monitor display and the transparent texture

			* The content to the left is supposed to be on the monitors to the right, also the bottom one is supposed to `black/white` not colored.
		* Turtle Texture for some reason?

## Contributing
Any contribution is welcome, be that using the mod, reporting bugs or contributing code. In order to start helping develop CC: R there are a few rules;
1) Follow the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) programming guidelines as close as possible. This means you have to use [`loom`](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:mappings) mappings, if you use anything else, your code will be rejected.
2) You cannot intentionally implement bugs and security vulnerabilities.
3) Unless the code is taken directly from CC: Tweaked, `lua` code is offlimits from alteration. New lua code changes should target the [CC:T repo](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked).

## Known Bugs/Issues
Main Known issue
* Mods that add blocks that can be used as peripherals for CC: T on Forge, don't work with CC: R.
	* This is because of the differences between Forge and [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), and that mod devs, to my knowledge have not agreed upon a standard method in which to implement cross compatibility between mods,
* Occasionally a computer will say "File not found" when running a built in program, this is normal just hold `crtl+r` to reboot it.
	* We do not know what causes it directly, however it happens when the world is `/reload`ed, and currently running programs are not affected so nothing *should break*

## Perpherals
Unfortunately, unlike the original CC: Tweaked project, CC: Restitched, does not have any actual peripheral mods, currently the only one we have is an example for mod devs to get started with making/adding the peripheral API to their mods!

If you're a mod dev, made a mod with CC: R peripheral support OR if you're a player who found a mod with CC: R support, please open an [issue here](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/issues/new?assignees=&labels=peripheralShoutout&template=peripheral_shoutout.md) to let us know so we can add it to the list!

	* This is an example mod for how to make peripherals that work as a block, or as a turtle upgrade!
